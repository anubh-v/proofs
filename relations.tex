\begin{enumerate}
\item The equivalence classes of an equivalence relation partition the domain of
the relation

\item If a partition of a set exists, then there exists an equivalence relation
over the set such that there is a bijection between the equivalence classes and
the sets of the partition

\item A function is bijective $\iff$ its inverse function exists

\item For functions f, g, $f \circ g = I$ and $g \circ f = I$ $\iff$ $f = g^{-1}$

\end{enumerate}
